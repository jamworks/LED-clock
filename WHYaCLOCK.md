###Why make a clock?

It's my beginner project with an Arduino UNO and a clock chip. 
I wanted to make it with only 12 RGB leds and us color and brightness to make it 
obvious visually "what time is it". This will reflect the whys for doing this.
I started this in August of 2011.

After making sure the Laser cut box fit together and all 12 of the BlipTronics LPD6803-based RGB LED 8mm Modules 
were soldered into a string and tested, it looks like a clock. I used ome oiginal code by Bliptronics.com Ben Moyes 2009
some Led code cleaned up and Object-ified by ladyada 2010 and added a few bits to make it all work together.

The [DS1307 Real Time Clock breakout board kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/264) is from Adafruit.
